\begin{abstract}
  We present a new library which automates the construction of equivalence
  proofs between polynomials over commutative rings and semirings in the
  programming language Agda \cite{norell_dependently_2008}. It is asymptotically
  faster than Agda's existing solver. We use reflection to provide a simple
  interface to the solver, and demonstrate a novel use of the constructed
  relations: step-by-step solutions.

\section{Introduction}
Doing mathematics in dependently-typed programming languages like Agda has a
reputation for being tedious, awkward, and difficult. Even simple arithmetic
identities like the one in Fig.~\ref{comparison} require fussy proofs
(Fig.~\ref{ring-proof}).

This need not be the case! With some carefully-designed tools, mathematics in
Agda can be easy, friendly, and fun. This work describes one such tool: an
Agda library which automates the construction of these kinds of proofs, making
them as easy as Fig.~\ref{the-solver}.

As you might expect, our solver comes accompanied by a formal proof of
correctness. Beyond that, though, we also strove to satisfy the following
requirements:
\begin{description}
  \item[Friendliness and Ease of Use] Proofs like the one in
    Fig.~\ref{ring-proof} aren't just boring: they're \emph{difficult}.
    The programmer needs to remember the particular syntax for each step (``is
    it \(\AgdaFunction{+-comm}\) or \(\AgdaFunction{+-commutative}\)?''), and
    often they have to put up with poor error messages.

    We believe this kind of difficulty is why Agda's current ring solver
    \cite{danielsson_agda_2018} enjoys little widespread use. Its interface
    (Fig.~\ref{old-solver}) is almost as verbose as the manual proof, and it
    requires programmers to learn another syntax specific to the solver.

    Our solver strives to be as easy to use as possible: the high-level
    interface is simple (Fig.~\ref{the-solver}), we don't require anything
    of the user other than an implementation of one of the supported algebras,
    and effort is made to generate useful error messages.
  \item[Performance] Typechecking dependently-typed code is a costly task.
    Automated solvers like the one presented here can greatly exacerbate this
    cost: in our experience, it wasn't uncommon for Agda's current ring solver
    to spend upwards of 10 minutes proving a single expression.

    In practice, this means two things: firstly, formalizations of large
    sections of mathematics can potentially take hours to typecheck (by which
    time the programmer has understandably given up on mathematics altogether);
    secondly, certain identities can take simply too long to prove, effectively
    making them unprovable.

    There are well-known techniques for optimizing the kind of solver we provide
    here, most of them described in \cite{gregoire_proving_2005}. Translating
    these optimizations into Agda was far from straightforward, however, and we
    found the performance benefits to be quite fragile. We did eventually
    achieve consistent and significant speedups, though, with very different
    techniques.
  \item[Educational Features] While our solver comes with the benefit of formal
    correctness, it's still playing catch-up to other less-rigorous computer
    algebra systems in terms of features. These features have driven systems
    like Wolfram|Alpha \cite{wolfram_research_inc._wolframalpha_2019} to
    widespread popularity among (for instance) students learning mathematics.

    We will take just one of those features (``pedagogical'', or step-by-step
    solutions \cite{the_development_team_step-by-step_2009}), and reimplement it
    in Agda using our solver. In doing so, we will explore some of the theory
    behind it, and present a formalism to describe these solutions.
\end{description}
